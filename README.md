This is a rock, paper, scissors game in Javascript to learn the fundamentals.
I've deliberately left this bare-bones, for the followin reason:
    The instructions were to create this game entirely running in the console, and 
    while it's amazing what other people have come up with and what they've done following
    tutorials on youtube to create a fully interactive and visual game, I think there's 
    something to be said for following the instructions, and creating something within the
    limitations you've been provided. It was actually more of a challenge for me to figure out
    how to get this to run entirely within the console, and to iterate 5 times as per
    the instructions and display the correct result each time, so while it doesn't look
    pretty, it does exactly what it's supposed to in a very short amount of code, which I'm 
    quite proud of. For me, this project demonstrates following instructions, working within 
    the environments you're instructed to, and making it as efficient as possible.
